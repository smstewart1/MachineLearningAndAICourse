# MachineLearningAndAICourse

This repository contains the collections of code I used to complete assignment in my IBM AI Engineering cerfiticate through Coursera. Implementation of AI and machine learning used packages such as Keras, PyTorch, and tensorFlow and culimated in a capstone project.  

Neural networks were build, optimized, and validated using the Keras packages.

I'll update this description and I work through the certification.
